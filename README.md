Relative.rb
===========

Provides relative (to the requiring file) requires. This should solve most of
the uglyness of pushing to $LOAD_PATH and loading #expand_path-ed files.

Example
-------

Dir with :
a.rb
b/c.rb

in c.rb:

require '../a' # <= this ensures that c.rb is from the same path

ruby -relative <path/to/c>
